<p><strong>No. 19 Colorado</strong>(3-0) has already tripled its win total from last season and heads to No. 10 Oregon on Saturday as one of the biggest stories in sports. Colorado is one of eight ranked teams in the Pac-12, which is having an ironic renaissance before 10 of its members depart for other conferences.</p>
<h2>Recent Success</h2>
<p>The Colorado Experience (1) has been a doozy for three weeks, a phenomenon that has built upon itself with each victory and each highlight and each outlandish side drama. Upsetting <em>TCU</em>, dominating <em>Nebraska</em> and dramatically rallying to beat <em>Colorado State</em>—it’s been a ride. From receipts to Miss Peggy to sunglasses and hats to The Rock and Lil’ Wayne to Sanders children power rankings to a <strong>98-yard drive</strong>just before midnight Mountain Time, the 3–0 Buffaloes have been mesmerizing. And polarizing—although anyone who isn’t enjoying the Colorado show should probably do some self-reflection on why.
</p>
<p>But now it gets both bigger and harder for the next two weeks, with a trip to Oregon Saturday and a visit from <em>USC</em> on Sept. 30. The competition is better, the stakes are higher, the bandwagon gets even more crowded and the target on the backs of the Buffaloes grows as well.</p>
